      <h2>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>
      
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Leaves his family’s farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks
        to a Depression era program known as the “National Youth
        Administration.”
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian
        Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. “I saw how food changed
        them,” he said. “All of this left scars on me.”
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service.</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Marries wife of 69 years, Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget
        cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school to study
        under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistant plants.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is
        rejected. Instead, the military asks his lab to work on waterproof glue,
        DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology.</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant
        wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over
        the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of
        disease-resistant wheat – including varieties for each major climate on
        Earth.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Discovers a way to grow wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yielding
        American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It
        goes on to provide 95% of Mexico’s wheat.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian
        subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly
        expanding population.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>Receives the Nobel Peace Prize.</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and
        sorghum yields.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>Becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University.</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        States “we will have to double the world food supply by 2050.” Argues
        that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand,
        as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently
        dangerous because “we’ve been genetically modifying plants and animals
        for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting
        the best breeds.”
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>Dies at the age of 95.</li>
      <br />
    </ul>

    <p>
      “Borlaug’s life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching
      contribution that one man’s towering intellect, persistence and scientific
      vision can make to human peace and progress.”
    </p>
